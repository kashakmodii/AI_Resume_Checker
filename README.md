# AI_Resume_Checker
AI Resume Checker is an intelligent system that evaluates a candidate’s resume against predefined job descriptions and provides a match percentage based on content relevance. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, such as TF-IDF and cosine similarity, to perform semantic comparison between resumes and job roles.

➡️How It Works
1️⃣Select job title (from the ones available in job_description.txt)
2️⃣Upload your resume (PDF format)

➡️The system:
1️⃣Extracts text from the resume
2️⃣Uses TF-IDF to vectorize both job and resume text
3️⃣Calculates cosine similarity to measure match percentage
4️⃣Returns the matching score

⚙Technologies Used
Python 
NLP: NLTK, scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook
PyPDF2 (for reading resumes)
TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity
