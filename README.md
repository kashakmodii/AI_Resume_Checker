# AI_Resume_Checker
AI Resume Checker is an intelligent system that evaluates a candidate’s resume against predefined job descriptions and provides a match percentage based on content relevance. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, such as TF-IDF and cosine similarity, to perform semantic comparison between resumes and job roles.

➡️How It Works

1️⃣Select job title (from the ones available in job_description.txt)

2️⃣Upload your resume (PDF format)


➡️The system:

1️⃣Extracts text from the resume

2️⃣Uses TF-IDF to vectorize both job and resume text

3️⃣Calculates cosine similarity to measure match percentage

4️⃣Returns the matching score


⚙Technologies Used

1️⃣Python 

2️⃣NLP: NLTK, scikit-learn

3️⃣Jupyter Notebook
